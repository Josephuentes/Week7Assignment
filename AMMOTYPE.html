        <p>There are different types of bullets in every caliber that are meant penetrate armor or deal a lot of body damage</p>
        <p>The armor someone is wearing determines if the bullet will penetrate the armor or not.</p>
        <p>Armor ranges from Class 1 Armor and up to Class 6 Armor. The PsT gzh round has a hard time penetrating Class 4 and above.</p>

        <p>Depending the helmet and armor someone is wearing, you'd have to assess what bullet your using and where to shoot them.</p>
